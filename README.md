## **Makefile Usage**

This project includes a **Makefile** to simplify common tasks, such as
running tests and cleaning up temporary files. Below is an
explanation of the available rules.

### **Available Rules**

1. **`make test`**:

- Runs all tests in the project for supported languages (JavaScript, Python, C++).
- Each language's tests are executed as follows:
  - **JavaScript**: Runs with `npm test`.
  - **Python**: Runs with `pytest`.
  - **C++**: Uses `cmake`, `make`, and `ctest`.

**Example**:

```bash
make test
```

2. **`make test-js`**:

- Runs only JavaScript tests.
- Executes tests in the `tests/__tests__` directory.

**Example**:

```bash
make test-js
```

3. **`make test-python`**:

- Runs only Python tests using `pytest`.
- Executes tests in the `tests/python` directory.
- This command does not generate visualizations.

**Example**:

```bash
make test-python
```

4. **`make test-cpp`**:

- Runs C++ tests.
- Creates a `build` directory in the project root to store temporary build files.
- Executes tests using `ctest --output-on-failure` to display detailed error
  messages if tests fail.

**Example**:

```bash
make test-cpp
```

5. **`make visualize`**:
   Generates visualizations for specific Python tests. This command runs Python tests with the `--visualize` flag, which enables the generation of visual outputs for supported problems.
   The visualizations for the problems are not included in the repository.

   **Steps in make visualize**:

   1. Executes Python tests using `pytest` in the `tests/python` directory.
   2. Generates visualizations for supported problems and stores them in the `*_images` directory.

**Example**:

```bash
make visualize
```

6. **`make clean`**:

- Cleans up temporary files and build directories, including:
  - `build`
  - Python temporary files (`__pycache__`).

**Example**:

```bash
make clean
```

---

### **Project Structure for the Makefile**

The project separates tests, results, and visualizations into well-defined directories.

### **Key Points**

1. **problems/**: Contains solutions to all problems, categorized into topics like arrays, graphs, etc.

2. **tests/**: Organized by language:

- **JavaScript (**tests**/)**: Test written for solutions in JavaScript.
- **C++ (cpp/)**: C++ tests managed using CMake and Google Test.
- **Python (python/)**: Tests for Python solutions, executed with `pytest`. Includes a
  `conftest.py` file for shared configurations and a `utility.py` file for helper functions.

3. **test_cases/**: JSON files specifying input and expected output for all problems, ensuring consistent testing across languages.

4. **scripts/**: Utility scripts like `update_readme.py` for project maintenance.

5. **makefile**: Provides automation for running tests across all languages and other tasks like visualization generation and cleanup.

---

### **Example Workflow**

1. **Run all tests**:
   Run all JavaScript, Python, and C++ tests in the project:

```bash
make test
```

2. **Run tests for a specific language**:

- **JavaScript**:

  ```bash
  make test-js
  ```

- **Python**:

  ```bash
  make test-python
  ```

- **C++**:
  ```bash
  make test-cpp
  ```

3. **Generate visualizations**:
   Generate visualizations for Python tests that support this feature:

```bash
make visualize
```

4. **Clean temporary files**:

```bash
make clean
```

5. **View Makefile Help**:
   List all available Makefile rules:

```bash
make help
```

---

### **Prerequisites**

Before using the Makefile, ensure the following tools are installed:

- **JavaScript**:

  - Node.js and npm (for running tests with Jest).
  - Install dependencies using:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

- **Python**:

  - Python 3.x installed with the following libraries:

    - `pytest` for running Python tests.
    - `matplotlib` for creating visualizations.
    - `networkx` for graph-based visualizations.
    - `graphviz` for tree and graph visualizations.
    - `fpdf` for generating PDF files.

  - **Install the required Python libraries**:

    ```bash
    pip install pytest matplotlib networkx graphviz fpdf2
    ```

    Additionally, ensure that Graphviz is installed on your system. You can install it using:

    - **macOS (with Homebrew)**:
      ```bash
      brew install graphviz
      ```
    - **Ubuntu**:
      ```bash
      sudo apt-get install graphviz
      ```
    - **Windows**:
      Download the Graphviz installer from the [official website](https://graphviz.org/download/).

- **C++**:
  - CMake (version 3.14 or higher).
  - A compiler supporting C++17 (e.g., GCC or Clang).
  - Google Test (`GTest`) and `nlohmann/json` libraries installed.
